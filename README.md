# AWS Serverless Tutorial

In this tutorial we will be creating a serverless function with AWS Lambda.

This tutorial will touch upon the following services and topics:
* Lambda
* S3
* Api Gateway
* Python
* Terraform

The tutorial consists of 3 parts:
1. Deploy a basic Lambda function via the AWS console
2. Create a Lamba function locally and deploy using S3
3. Deploy a Lambda function using Terraform

We aim to finish the tutorial in 1 hour. This is assuming every participant has successfully finished the prerequisites.
