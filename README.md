# AWS Serverless Tutorial

In this tutorial we will be creating a serverless function with AWS Lambda.

This tutorial will touch upon the following services and topics:
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* AWS Api Gateway
* AWS logging (Cloudwatch & X-Ray)
* Python
* Terraform

The tutorial consists of 3 parts:
1. Deploy a basic Lambda function via the AWS console
2. Create a Lamba function locally and deploy using S3
3. Deploy a Lambda function using Terraform

We aim to finish the tutorial in 1 hour. This is assuming every participant has successfully finished the [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md). 

### clean up afterwards
Don't forget to destroy your resources in AWS at the end to avoid incurring unnecessary costs!
